# CW3-HARRY-PARTH-GRAZIA-MOHAMMED
CW3 python file to solve all size sudokus as efficiently as possible.

This is a Python script for a Sudoku solver program. The program uses three technqiues to solve the sudoku grids as efficiently as possible. The program runs in the Git bash terminal.

Follow the steps below to the run the program properly:

1- Download the least version of Python from the Web in to you PC.

2- Once Downloaded, Click on the "Add Python 3.11.3 to PATH" in the installer window then Click on install now. Note that "3.11.3" numbers maybe different for yours so no need to worry about that.

3-In Git bash navigate to the file called "CW3_HARRY_PARTH_GRAZIA_MOHAMMED" from your PC.

4- Open and run the Program "CW3_FINAL_V2.py" using a software that run Python scripts.

5- Install the matplotlib libary if you haven't, using "pip install matplotlib".

6- Install the numpy libary if you haven't, using "pip install numpy".



Project features:

It is an open-source program and simple to use.

Includes grids in the script and within files provided with increasing difficulty.

Includes flags that are called in the Git bash terminal.

Using flags it produces solutions, hints, and explain of a grid as well as a plot of the performance of the solvers in the script.

There is an additional flag called wavefront which is representing the smallest possible values for each grid location within a grid.



Project usage of the implemented flags:

-File -> "./CW3_FINAL_V2.py -file", Must have a file input and output entered to solve a grid.

-Hints -> "./CW3_FINAL_V2.py -hint"

-Explain -> "./CW3_FINAL_V2.py -explain"

-Profile -> "./CW3_FINAL_V2.py -profile" with  or without a file(s) input, it produces a plot.

-wavefront -> "./CW3_FINAL_V2.py -wavefront"
