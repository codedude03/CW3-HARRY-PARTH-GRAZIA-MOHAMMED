# Running log of notes to be implemented into our working program

28/03/2023 [13:31]
- added '__main()__' function to a draft copy of the program
- added input/output flag (& comments to mark out other flags required):
	---> also added an explanation flag by adding a line of code to the main recursive function (line 197)
		-> then called the list of instruxtions generated in the main() function
		-> made the grids and list of explanation points global (in lines 249 and 315) to do so (without retuning more varibales from a function)
- added a USAGE_MESSAGE constant
- copied the practise grids from BB into the main directory to call it easily from the terminal (once in the same directory)
- marked out areas of possible error to explain to the user
- moved duplicate checker function ('dup_check') out of the recursive_solve function 
	---> feeding 'n' as an argument to avoid repetition
- !NEED TO: add docstrings to all functions; write full error messages were needed; merge flagging code to complete Task 1&2

- minimised some functions and loops to take up less space (please expand if needed when editing)
- QUESTIONS:	what is index_found needed for in line 128?; 
		do we have to be able to parse multiples of the same flag (e.g. multiple input and output files at once)?;
		how do we make sure that the number of hints doesn't exceed the number of empty spaces (or is negative);
		confused, are we supposed to measure the performance of the solver based on grids the user enters? - same with explain flag?

- added separate function to perform given certain flags are entered (i.e. in/out and explain?)
- added general comments (including those just for temporary use in editing)
- !NEED TO: 	- merge flagging code to complete Task 1&2; 
		- use the get_squares function given to check for square duplicates (in the recursive solve function)?;
		- start task 3, waveform solver (delegate parts)
