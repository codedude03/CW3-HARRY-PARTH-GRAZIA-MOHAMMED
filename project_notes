# Running log of notes to be implemented into our working program

28/03/2023 [13:31]
- added '__main()__' function to a draft copy of the program
- added input/output flag (& comments to mark out other flags required):
	---> also added an explanation flag by adding a line of code to the main recursive function (line 197)
		-> then called the list of instruxtions generated in the main() function
		-> made the grids and list of explanation points global (in lines 249 and 315) to do so (without retuning more varibales from a function)
- added a USAGE_MESSAGE constant
- copied the practise grids from BB into the main directory to call it easily from the terminal (once in the same directory)
- marked out areas of possible error to explain to the user
- moved duplicate checker function ('dup_check') out of the recursive_solve function 
	---> feeding 'n' as an argument to avoid repetition
- !NEED TO: add docstrings to all functions; write full error messages were needed; merge flagging code to complete Task 1&2
